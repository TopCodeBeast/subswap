# Subswap is a permissionless value exchange protocol based on Substrate
- Automated Market Making (AMM) decentralized exchange (DEX) for Polkadot/Substrate blockchains with fast, low-fee transactions
- A on-chain treasury to support stability, fund open-source development, vote on protocol upgrades, increase decentralization
- Fair distribution mechanism of SUB governance tokens that enable community control & evolution of the procotol 

The SUB governance token is focused on laying the foundation of the next generation ofinteroperable cryptoeconomic activities. We (underwater-squad) expect
- Experiments in AMM models including Proactive Market Making & Single-Sided Liquidity (DODO), low slippage and fees for stable assets (Curve/Blackholeswap) & Multi-asset pools (Balancer)
- Optimized DEX orders across all liquidity pools for best price execution.

## Trying it out

### For developers
Subswap is developed in a way that it is compatible to the latest [substrate](www.github.com/paritytech/substrate) project dependencies.
To contribute to this project, Simply go to [substrate.dev](https://substrate.dev) and follow the 
[installation](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/getting-started/) instructions. You can 
also try out one of the [tutorials](https://substrate.dev/en/tutorials).

### For users

Subswap is a permissionless decentralized finance and exchange protocol where holders are rewarded for their activities such as providing liquidity, creating values through decentralization, connecting two different assets with exchanging, and acting in on-chain governance.

### Create values

Create values with [asset module](./frame/asset/lib.rs)'s `issue` function. Users can issue their own asset for their personal use or propose to the public to issue with [Democracy](./frame/democracy/lib.rs) module's propose function to get agreement from holders that the asset has value. When the proposal passes, one can claim his asset's legitmacy by showing proposal hash which is permanently recorded in the blockchain.

### Exchange values

Create pairs between two assets to exchange. Liquidity providers are rewarded as liquidity provider tokens(a.k.a LP token), and users can claim their rewards by burning it or stake to pools to get SUB, the base currency of subswap protocol. Pairs are developed to create the least impermanent loss 

### yield farming

SUB is the native currency of Subswap network. SUB will be inititally rewarded to liquidity providers who creates cryptocurrency ecosystem. To reward providing liquidity. SUB pools are created to stake lptokens and get SUB. The SUB token is intended to have NO value. There will be NO pre-mine and NO developer fund. We will accomplish this in 3 phases:

### Democracy
*For the liquidity providers, By the liquidity providers* 

SUB will determine the future of Subswap protocol. SUB council and holders will determine:
- Future utility of SUB token 
- Reward rates of SUB liquidity poolsx
- Deteremine incentized pools to be rewarded with SUB tokens
- Fund research for new features (e.g. synthetic assets, derivatives, insurance)

### Treasury

SUB funds can be made to reward open source developers who bridge other heteregeneous crypto assets and Subswap protocol assets. 

### Contract

To provide utility to tokens registered in the subswap protocol, developers can setup business logic with [ink!]() to interact with SUB and other registered tokens.

## License

- Substrate Primitives (`sp-*`), Frame (`frame-*`) and the pallets (`pallets-*`), binaries (`/bin`) and all other utilities are licensed under [Apache 2.0](LICENSE-APACHE2).
- Subswap Primitives(`swp-*`), Frame(`subswap-*`) and the pallets (`subswap-*`) are licensed under [Apache 2.0](LICENSE-APACHE2).
- Substrate Client (`/client/*` / `sc-*`) is licensed under [GPL v3.0 with a classpath linking exception](LICENSE-GPL3).

The reason for the split-licensing is to ensure that for the vast majority of teams using Substrate to create feature-chains, then all changes can be made entirely in Apache2-licensed code, allowing teams full freedom over what and how they release and giving licensing clarity to commercial teams.

In the interests of the community, we require any deeper improvements made to Substrate's core logic (e.g. Substrate's internal consensus, crypto or database code) to be contributed back so everyone can benefit.
